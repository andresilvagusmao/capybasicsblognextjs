## Who am I?
My name is **André Silva Gusmão**. I am currently a back-end developper but I have worked as front-end developer, full-stack developer and some experience with dev-ops. 

I have experience with front-end development, mostly Angular, and back-end development, mostly .Net. I have some experience with Java, Node, DotNet MVC, Vue, Vanilla JS.

## What is the purpose of this Blog?
This blog is the "blog." subdomain from the domain [capybasics.com](https://capybasics.com). In this subdomain I will post part of my experiences related to software development. I want to share some content to help people that might face the same situation as me.

**I will no go in depth about the subjects (capyBASICS)**. CapyBASICS will focus on the basic aspect of the subjects I am posting, I want them to work as a starting point reference/follow along for some people that want to start learning about a subject.
